# Advent of Code 2021
These are puzzles for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
challenge, written and solved in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

The puzzle for each day is in its own folder in `src/bin`, and can be run
using the following command (from the root folder):

```
cargo run --bin day1
```

If a particular day has tests, you can also run those:

```
cargo test --bin day1
```

## The Puzzles
This year, I've put each day into its own folder because then I can give
each its own README. I'll use this to write a little explanation of how
it works, why I did something a certain way, or some other useful notes
that may be helpful to people learning.
